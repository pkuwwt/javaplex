\section{Introduction}

Well, the usual \ldots\ and also some citations, see~\cite{g-atpwog-2006}  \ldots\
Large parts of this document are stolen from~\cite{s-eef-2008}.

\begin{conj}
Could it really be like this?
\end{conj}
\begin{obs}
Probably not  \ldots\
\end{obs}

\begin{defini}
Some things are just not definable  \ldots\
\end{defini}

\begin{theorem}
This is the most important theorem.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
It even comes with a proof  \ldots\
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
And then we also found this lemma  \ldots\
\end{lemma}

There should be some more text explaining research results in some
additional sections, but since this is only an example file \ldots\ on
the other hand \ldots\ well, no! But some figures with illustrative
examples would not hurt, either \ldots\


\section{Code examples}

You may use the \texttt{verbatim} \LaTeX\ environment for adding code
snapshots, or, for that matter any other similar environment.
\begin{verbatim}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello GTS 2012" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Dummy section}
This is dummy section to make the document go to two pages.

\section{Conclusion}

What we did is amazing and improves everything that was there before.
