@article{Carlsson_04,
    abstract = {We show that the persistent homology of a filtered d-dimensional simplicial complex is simply the standard homology of a particular graded module over a polynomial ring. Our analysis establishes the existence of a simple description of persistent homology groups over arbitrary fields. It also enables us to derive a natural algorithm for computing persistent homology of spaces in arbitrary dimension over any field. This results generalizes and extends the previously known algorithm that was restricted to subcomplexes of S},
