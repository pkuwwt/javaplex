@book{HATCHER,
    abstract = {
This book is one of the most interesting and
accessible texts to come out in recent years. The subject is presented in
three broad areas: elementary notions including fundamental group, homology
and cohomology, and homotopy theory. In most cases, some of the more
sophisticated topics, such as \$H\$-spaces, Bockstein homomorphisms and Hopf
invariants, are placed in sections called "Additional Topics" at the end
of the appropriate chapter.
<P>
The style is refreshingly informal, although precise definitions are always
given. The author always prepares the reader for the next idea, and there
are basic, simple black and white pictures which really help. He is not
afraid to repeat ideas with increasing generality. For example, there are
treatments of Postnikov towers which begin with a cellular version, go on
to the usual tower of principal fibrations and end with Moore-Postnikov
decompositions. The reviewer finds this a very "student-friendly"
approach (very different from the texts which always look for the greatest
generality). There are many excellent examples.
<P>
The author talks about two further volumes involving spectral sequences and
\$K\$-theory. When complete, this will be a major achievement which will help a
great many serious students.},

@book{Rotman,
    abstract = {With a wealth of examples as well as abundant applications to algebra, this is a must-read work: an easy-to-follow, step-by-step guide to homological algebra. The author provides a treatment of homological algebra which approaches the subject in terms of its origins in algebraic topology. In this brand new edition the text has been fully updated and revised throughout and new material on sheaves and abelian categories has been added. Applications include the following: * to rings -- Lazard's theorem that flat modules are direct limits of free modules, Hilbert's Syzygy Theorem, Quillen-Suslin's solution of Serre's problem about projectives over polynomial rings, Serre-Auslander-Buchsbaum characterization of regular local rings (and a sketch of unique factorization); * to groups -- Schur-Zassenhaus, Gaschutz's theorem on outer automorphisms of finite p-groups, Schur multiplier, cotorsion groups; * to sheaves -- sheaf cohomology, Cech cohomology, discussion of Riemann-Roch Theorem over compact Riemann surfaces. Learning homological algebra is a two-stage affair. Firstly, one must learn the language of Ext and Tor, and what this describes. Secondly, one must be able to compute these things using a separate language: that of spectral sequences. The basic properties of spectral sequences are developed using exact couples. All is done in the context of bicomplexes, for almost all applications of spectral sequences involve indices. Applications include Grothendieck spectral sequences, change of rings, Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre sequence, and theorems of Leray and Cartan computing sheaf cohomology.},

@book{CLR,
    abstract = {Aimed at any serious programmer or computer science student, the new second edition of \_Introduction to Algorithms\_ builds on the tradition of the original with a truly magisterial guide to the world of algorithms. Clearly presented, mathematically rigorous, and yet approachable even for the maths- averse, this title sets a high standard for a textbook and reference to the best algorithms for solving a wide range of computing problems. With sample problems and mathematical proofs demonstrating the correctness of each algorithm, this book is ideal as a textbook for classroom study, but its reach doesn't end there. The authors do a fine job at explaining each algorithm. (Reference sections on basic mathematical notation will help readers bridge the gap, but it will help to have some maths background to appreciate the full achievement of this handsome hardcover volume.) Every algorithm is presented in pseudo-code, which can be implemented in any computer language, including C/C++ and Java. This ecumenical approach is one of the book's strengths. When it comes to sorting and common data structures, from basic linked list to trees (including binary trees, red-black and B-trees), this title really shines with clear diagrams that show algorithms in operation. Even if you glance over the mathematical notation here, you can definitely benefit from this text in other ways. The book moves forward with more advanced algorithms that implement strategies for solving more complicated problems (including dynamic programming techniques, greedy algorithms, and amortised analysis). Algorithms for graphing problems (used in such real-world business problems as optimising flight schedules or flow through pipelines) come next. In each case, the authors provide the best from current research in each topic, along with sample solutions. This text closes with a grab bag of useful algorithms including matrix operations and linear programming, evaluating polynomials and the well-known Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) (useful in signal processing and engineering). Final sections on "NP-complete" problems, like the well-known traveloling salesmen problem, show off that while not all problems have a demonstrably final and best answer, algorithms that generate acceptable approximate solutions can still be used to generate useful, real-world answers. Throughout this text, the authors anchor their discussion of algorithms with current examples drawn from molecular biology (like the Human Genome project), business, and engineering. Each section ends with short discussions of related historical material often discussing original research in each area of algorithms. In all, they argue successfully that algorithms are a "technology" just like hardware and software that can be used to write better software that does more with better performance. Along with classic books on algorithms (like Donald Knuth's three-volume set, \_The Art of Computer Programming\_), this title sets a new standard for compiling the best research in algorithms. For any experienced developer, regardless of their chosen language, this text deserves a close look for extending the range and performance of real-world software. \_--Richard Dragan\_},

@book{Statistical_Learning,
    abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and
information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of
fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of
understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field
of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning,
and bioinformatics.

Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with
different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas
in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the
emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with
a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for
statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry.

The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to
unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector
machines, classification trees and boosting--the first comprehensive treatment
of this topic in any book.

Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of
statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this
area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a
popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling
software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani
proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to
the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including
CART, MARS, and projection pursuit.

FROM THE REVIEWS:

TECHNOMETRICS "[This] is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates
on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them.
Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a
source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long
time before there is a competitor to this book."},

This results generalizes and extends the previously known algorithm that was restricted to subcomplexes of S},

The clear and straightforward presentation features many illustrations, and provides complete proofs for most theorems. The material requires only linear algebra as a prerequisite, but takes the reader quickly from the basics to topics of recent research, including a number of unanswered questions. The lectures - introduce the basic facts about polytopes, with an emphasis on the methods that yield the results (Fourier-Motzkin elimination, Schlegel diagrams, shellability, Gale transforms, and oriented matroids) - discuss important examples and elegant constructions (cyclic and neighborly polytopes, zonotopes, Minkowski sums, permutahedra and associhedra, fiber polytopes, and the Lawrence construction) - show the excitement of current work in the field (Kalai's new diameter bounds, construction of non-rational polytopes, the Bohne-Dress tiling theorem, the upper-bound theorem), and nonextendable shellings) They should provide interesting and enjoyable reading for researchers as well as students.}},

We implement this method and present a few sample applications in which simple descriptions of the data present important information about its structure.}

This quality implies that the problem is difficult to deal with in practice.<p> The focus of this book is to teach the reader how to identify, deal with, and understand the essence of NP-complete problems; <I>Computers and Intractability</I> does all of those things effectively. In a readable yet mathematically rigorous manner, the book covers topics such as how to prove that a given problem is NP-complete and how to cope with NP-complete problems.

    abstract = {We show that determining the Jones polynomial of an alternating link is \#P-hard. This is a special case of a wide range of results on the general intractability of the evaluation of the Tutte polynomial {T(M}; x, y) of a matroid M except for a few listed special points and curves of the (x, y)-plane. In particular the problem of evaluating the Tutte polynomial of a graph at a point in the (x, y)-plane is \#P-hard except when (x 1) = 1 or when (x, y) equals (1, 1), (1), (0, 1, 0), (i, i, i), (j, j2), (j2, j) where j = e2\&\#960;i/3},

@book{Bollobas,
    abstract = {{This is a new edition of the now classic text. The already extensive treatment given in the first edition has been heavily revised by the author. The addition of two new sections, numerous new results and 150 references means that this represents an up-to-date and comprehensive account of random graph theory. The theory estimates the number of graphs of a given degree that exhibit certain properties. It not only has numerous combinatorial applications, but also serves as a model for the probabilistic treatment of more complicated random structures. This book, written by an acknowledged expert in the field, can be used by mathematicians, computer scientists and electrical engineers, as well as people working in biomathematics. It is self contained, and with numerous exercises in each chapter, is ideal for advanced courses or self study.}},
